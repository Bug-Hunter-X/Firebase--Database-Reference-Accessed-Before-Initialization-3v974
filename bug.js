This error occurs when you try to access a Firebase Realtime Database reference before it's fully initialized. This can happen if you attempt to read or write data within the app's initialization phase before the Firebase app instance is completely ready.  The asynchronous nature of Firebase initialization is the culprit. For instance:

```javascript
// Incorrect - accessing ref before initialization completes
firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const db = firebase.database();
const userRef = db.ref('users');
userRef.once('value').then(snapshot => {
  // ...process snapshot...
});
```

The `initializeApp` method is asynchronous; it doesn't finish instantly.  Trying to use the database before it's initialized leads to unexpected behavior or silent failures.
